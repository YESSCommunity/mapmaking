# Mapmaking Course Repository

This repository contains Python scripts and sample datasets for creating different types of maps, including single maps, multiple maps, and animated maps. These materials are part of the Mapmaking course hosted by the YESS Community.

We are actively updating the scripts. You are welcome (and encouraged) to request specific changes or suggest new features. We will do our best to accommodate them.

Have fun, and happy mapping!
